  What I should have been blogging about

  </h2>

<p>A lot has happened. So to get this whole blogging thing started up again
  I'll let out a stream of thoughts and edit and expound on them later.</p>
<p>I quit Mozilla. That was liberating and sad at the same time. Kinda poked
  around a bit on some side projects. Started a bunch of things. Finished fewer.
  Started screen printing again. That was great as it's helping to hit that
  spot where you need to be creative with your hands. Made a bunch of shirts
  for a DJ friend. Got in to <a href="http://www.picaxe.com/">PICAXE</a> and learned enough BASIC to control a <a href="http://www.mdfly.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=9_53&amp;products_id=284">MP3 Player Module RS232-TTL</a>
  module which deserves <a href="/blog/adventures-with-picaxe-and-mp3-player-module-RS232.html" title="Adventures with PICAXE and MDFLY MP3 Player Module RS232">a few posts on it's own</a>. Got a Makerbot and am learning
  all the cool way to extrude plastics and about temp and speed and PLA vs ABS
  and feedrates and gcode and I'm learning Blender now which has a huge
  learning curve but it's so powerful and I'm getting better at it.</p>
<p>For a few weeks I didn't program at all. It was strange. I almost thought I
  would forget everything but that didn't happen. Quite the reverse actually!
  When I sat down I just grunted out a few solutions that had been bugging me
  for a while.</p>
<p>I bought a motorcycle. Took the California Safety course and that was fun.
  It's pretty strange to not be contained by your vehicle but instead be around
  it and hurtling down the freeway. Very new experience for me.</p>
<p>Got a handful of the Makerbot Mixtape modules and made a custom 3d printed mp3
  player for my DJ friend to sell.</p>
<p>Talking with a buddy about going to Taiwan. I'm down for that or Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Right now I need to package a new app I made for django. It's integrates Stripe
  for credit card processing to Cartridge which is an commerce platform addon in Mezzanine.</p>
<p>Also I'm trying to print a woman's shoe. Yeah, sounds strange but I got the idea
  from continuumfashion and so far feedback has been encouraging.</p>
<p>Ok enough for now.</p>
