        Yo dawg! I heard you like codez! So I put a compiler in your code so you can code while you're coding.

[Last post](/blog/python-sandbox-with-pypy.html) was setting up and translating Pypy to make a sandboxed python prompt
that had it's own virtual /tmp and no system calls.

Now we'll take it a step farther and wrap it in normal python and run untrusted
python within the sandbox programmatically.
