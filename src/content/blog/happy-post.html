title: PYPY sandbox for safe execution of arbitrary python code

        Yo dawg! I heard you like codez! So I put a compiler in your code so you can code while you're coding.

So I wanted to run some untrusted code. Javascript looked good because it could
run in the browser (a natural sandbox). But I needed it to run server side too. 

Pypy popped up on a few sites but it was a bit unclear on the use case for it at
first. But this [helped](http://pypy.org/features.html#sandboxing). Plus, I like
python :)

{%- endmark %}

So here is who to install it on ubuntu. A lot of help came from [this dude](http://www.stephendiehl.com/?p=295) 

I was on his site and [here](http://pypy.org/download.html#translate) every day for a
week.

<pre class="bash"><code>&#36; sudo apt-get install \                                                                                                                                            
gcc make python-dev libffi-dev pkg-config \
libz-dev libbz2-dev libncurses-dev libexpat1-dev \
libssl-dev libgc-dev python-sphinx python-greenlet
</code></pre>

Get the source and start the translatino process

<pre class="bash"><code>&#36; wget http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.4.1-src.tar.bz2
&#36; tar -jxvf  ./pypy-1.4.1-src.tar.bz2
&#36; cd ./pypy-1.4.1-src/pypy/translator/goal
&#36; python translate.py --sandbox
</code></pre>

Grab a bite to eat or a cup of tea

Now while you are still in ~/pypy-1.4.1-src/pypy/translator/goal

<pre><code>&#36; sudo ln -s &grave;pwd&grave;../sandbox/pypy_interact.py /usr/local/bin/pypy_interact.py </code></pre> 

Go home!

<pre><code>&#36; cd 
</code></pre>

Make a symlink of the source to /opt

<pre><code>&#36; sudo ln -s &grave;pwd&grave;/pypy-1.4.1-src/ /opt/pypy-sandbox </code></pre>

Now let's test it...

Should see prompt and don't go further if you don't

<pre><code>&#36; pypy_interact.py /opt/pypy-sandbox/pypy/translator/goal/pypy-c
</code></pre>

Now let's test the sandbox! Make a dummy file and put it in the virutal tmp folder

<pre><code>&#36; mkdir ~/virtualtmp
&#36; echo Good day Sire! &gt; ~/virtualtmp/greetings.txt
</code></pre>

Specify the ~/virtualtmp for /tmp in the sandbox

Note: the --tmp option is always relative to the prompt regardless of absolute
paths put there. So "/some/path/" is not from root and "~/a/path" is not from
home. It's all relative to the prompt.

<pre><code>&#36; pypy_interact.py --tmp=virtualtmp /opt/pypy-sandbox/pypy/translator/goal/pypy-c </code></pre>

Note: you'll see logging text as well, output will be in there somewhere ;)

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; f = open('/tmp/greetings.txt')
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; f.read()
'Good day Sire!\\n'
</code></pre>

Let's try opening it to write
But NO! you cannot!

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; f = open('/tmp/greetings.txt', 'r+')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
IOError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/tmp/greetings.txt'
</code></pre>

[crtl+c to exit]
They suggest installing ledit to have a saner prompt

<pre class="bash"><code>&#36; sudo apt-get install ledit
&#36; ledit python -u /usr/local/bin/pypy_interact.py --tmp=virtualtmp /opt/pypy-sandbox/pypy/translator/goal/pypy-cp
</code></pre>
