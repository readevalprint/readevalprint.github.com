            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;So I wanted to run some untrusted code. Javascript looked good because it could
run in the browser (a natural sandbox). But I needed it to run server side&amp;nbsp;too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pypy popped up on a few sites but it was a bit unclear on the use case for it at
first. But this &lt;a href=&#34;http://pypy.org/features.html#sandboxing&#34;&gt;helped&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, I like
python :)
So here is who to install it on ubuntu. A lot of help came from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stephendiehl.com/?p=295&#34;&gt;this&amp;nbsp;dude&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on his site and &lt;a href=&#34;http://pypy.org/download.html#translate&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; every day for a&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#36; sudo apt-get install \                                                                                                                                            
gcc make python-dev libffi-dev pkg-config \
libz-dev libbz2-dev libncurses-dev libexpat1-dev \
libssl-dev libgc-dev python-sphinx python-greenlet
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get the source and start the translatino&amp;nbsp;process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#36; wget http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.4.1-src.tar.bz2
&amp;#36; tar -jxvf  ./pypy-1.4.1-src.tar.bz2
&amp;#36; cd ./pypy-1.4.1-src/pypy/translator/goal
&amp;#36; python translate.py --sandbox
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grab a bite to eat or a cup of&amp;nbsp;tea&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now while you are still in&amp;nbsp;~/pypy-1.4.1-src/pypy/translator/goal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#36; sudo ln -s &amp;grave;pwd&amp;grave;../sandbox/pypy_interact.py /usr/local/bin/pypy_interact.py &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go&amp;nbsp;home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#36; cd 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a symlink of the source to&amp;nbsp;/opt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#36; sudo ln -s &amp;grave;pwd&amp;grave;/pypy-1.4.1-src/ /opt/pypy-sandbox &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#8217;s test&amp;nbsp;it&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should see prompt and don&amp;#8217;t go further if you&amp;nbsp;don&amp;#8217;t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#36; pypy_interact.py /opt/pypy-sandbox/pypy/translator/goal/pypy-c
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#8217;s test the sandbox! Make a dummy file and put it in the virutal tmp&amp;nbsp;folder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#36; mkdir ~/virtualtmp
&amp;#36; echo Good day Sire! &amp;gt; ~/virtualtmp/greetings.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specify the ~/virtualtmp for /tmp in the&amp;nbsp;sandbox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: the &amp;#8212;tmp option is always relative to the prompt regardless of absolute
paths put there. So &amp;#8220;/some/path/&amp;#8221; is not from root and &amp;#8220;~/a/path&amp;#8221; is not from
home. It&amp;#8217;s all relative to the&amp;nbsp;prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#36; pypy_interact.py --tmp=virtualtmp /opt/pypy-sandbox/pypy/translator/goal/pypy-c &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: you&amp;#8217;ll see logging text as well, output will be in there somewhere&amp;nbsp;;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f = open(&#39;/tmp/greetings.txt&#39;)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f.read()
&#39;Good day Sire!\\n&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s try opening it to write
But &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt;! you&amp;nbsp;cannot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f = open(&#39;/tmp/greetings.txt&#39;, &#39;r+&#39;)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &#34;&lt;console&gt;&#34;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
IOError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: &#39;/tmp/greetings.txt&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[crtl+c to exit]
They suggest installing ledit to have a saner&amp;nbsp;prompt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#36; sudo apt-get install ledit
&amp;#36; ledit python -u /usr/local/bin/pypy_interact.py --tmp=virtualtmp /opt/pypy-sandbox/pypy/translator/goal/pypy-cp

To complete the character-study of Mr. Worple, he was a man of extremely
uncertain temper, and his general tendency was to think that Corky was a poor
chump and that whatever step he took in any direction on his own account, was
just another proof of his innate idiocy. I should imagine Jeeves feels very
much the same about me.
So when Corky trickled into my apartment one afternoon, shooing a girl in
front of him, and said, &amp;#8220;Bertie, I want you to meet my fiancée, Miss Singer,&amp;#8221;
the aspect of the matter which hit me first was precisely the one which he had
come to consult me about. The very first words I spoke were, &amp;#8220;Corky, how about
your&amp;nbsp;uncle?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor chap gave one of those mirthless laughs. He was looking anxious and
worried, like a man who has done the murder all right but can&amp;#8217;t think what the
deuce to do with the&amp;nbsp;body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;We&amp;#8217;re so scared, Mr. Wooster,&amp;#8221; said the girl. &amp;#8220;We were hoping that you might
suggest a way of breaking it to&amp;nbsp;him.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muriel Singer was one of those very quiet, appealing girls who have a way of
looking at you with their big eyes as if they thought you were the greatest
thing on earth and wondered that you hadn&amp;#8217;t got on to it yet yourself. She sat
there in a sort of shrinking way, looking at me as if she were saying to
herself, &amp;#8220;Oh, I do hope this great strong man isn&amp;#8217;t going to hurt me.&amp;#8221; She
gave a fellow a protective kind of feeling, made him want to stroke her hand
and say, &amp;#8220;There, there, little one!&amp;#8221; or words to that effect. She made me feel
that there was nothing I wouldn&amp;#8217;t do for her. She was rather like one of those
innocent-tasting American drinks which creep imperceptibly into your system so
that, before you know what you&amp;#8217;re doing, you&amp;#8217;re starting out to reform the
world by force if necessary and pausing on your way to tell the large man in
the corner that, if he looks at you like that, you will knock his head off.
What I mean is, she made me feel alert and dashing, like a jolly old
knight-errant or something of that kind. I felt that I was with her in this
thing to the&amp;nbsp;limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t see why your uncle shouldn&amp;#8217;t be most awfully bucked,&amp;#8221; I said to
Corky. &amp;#8220;He will think Miss Singer the ideal wife for&amp;nbsp;you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corky declined to cheer&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;You don&amp;#8217;t know him. Even if he did like Muriel he wouldn&amp;#8217;t admit it. That&amp;#8217;s
the sort of pig-headed guy he is. It would be a matter of principle with him
to kick. All he would consider would be that I had gone and taken an important
step without asking his advice, and he would raise Cain automatically. He&amp;#8217;s
always done&amp;nbsp;it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strained the old bean to meet this&amp;nbsp;emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;You want to work it so that he makes Miss Singer&amp;#8217;s acquaintance without
knowing that you know her. Then you come&amp;nbsp;along&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;But how can I work it that&amp;nbsp;way?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw his point. That was the&amp;nbsp;catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;There&amp;#8217;s only one thing to do,&amp;#8221; I&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;What&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;that?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Leave it to&amp;nbsp;Jeeves.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I rang the&amp;nbsp;bell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Sir?&amp;#8221; said Jeeves, kind of manifesting himself. One of the rummy things about
Jeeves is that, unless you watch like a hawk, you very seldom see him come
into a room. He&amp;#8217;s like one of those weird chappies in India who dissolve
themselves into thin air and nip through space in a sort of disembodied way
and assemble the parts again just where they want them. I&amp;#8217;ve got a cousin
who&amp;#8217;s what they call a Theosophist, and he says he&amp;#8217;s often nearly worked the
thing himself, but couldn&amp;#8217;t quite bring it off, probably owing to having fed
in his boyhood on the flesh of animals slain in anger and&amp;nbsp;pie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment I saw the man standing there, registering respectful attention, a
weight seemed to roll off my mind. I felt like a lost child who spots his
father in the offing. There was something about him that gave me&amp;nbsp;confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeeves is a tallish man, with one of those dark, shrewd faces. His eye gleams
with the light of pure&amp;nbsp;intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Jeeves, we want your&amp;nbsp;advice.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Very good,&amp;nbsp;sir.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I boiled down Corky&amp;#8217;s painful case into a few well-chosen&amp;nbsp;words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;So you see what it amount to, Jeeves. We want you to suggest some way by
which Mr. Worple can make Miss Singer&amp;#8217;s acquaintance without getting on to the
fact that Mr. Corcoran already knows her.&amp;nbsp;Understand?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Perfectly,&amp;nbsp;sir.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Well, try to think of&amp;nbsp;something.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;I have thought of something already,&amp;nbsp;sir.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;You&amp;nbsp;have!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The scheme I would suggest cannot fail of success, but it has what may seem
to you a drawback, sir, in that it requires a certain financial&amp;nbsp;outlay.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;He means,&amp;#8221; I translated to Corky, &amp;#8220;that he has got a pippin of an idea, but
it&amp;#8217;s going to cost a&amp;nbsp;bit.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally the poor chap&amp;#8217;s face dropped, for this seemed to dish the whole
thing. But I was still under the influence of the girl&amp;#8217;s melting gaze, and I
saw that this was where I started in as a&amp;nbsp;knight-errant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;You can count on me for all that sort of thing, Corky,&amp;#8221; I said. &amp;#8220;Only too
glad. Carry on,&amp;nbsp;Jeeves.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;I would suggest, sir, that Mr. Corcoran take advantage of Mr. Worple&amp;#8217;s
attachment to&amp;nbsp;ornithology.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;How on earth did you know that he was fond of&amp;nbsp;birds?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

I went and dressed sadly. It will show you pretty well how pipped I was when I
tell you that I near as a toucher put on a white tie with a dinner-jacket. I
sallied out for a bit of food more to pass the time than because I wanted it.
It seemed brutal to be wading into the bill of fare with poor old Bicky headed
for the breadline.
When I got back old Chiswick had gone to bed, but Bicky was there, hunched up
in an arm-chair, brooding pretty tensely, with a cigarette hanging out of the
corner of his mouth and a more or less glassy stare in his eyes. He had the
aspect of one who had been soaked with what the newspaper chappies call &amp;#8220;some
blunt&amp;nbsp;instrument.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;This is a bit thick, old thing—what!&amp;#8221; I&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He picked up his glass and drained it feverishly, overlooking the fact that it
hadn&amp;#8217;t anything in&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;I&amp;#8217;m done, Bertie!&amp;#8221; he&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had another go at the glass. It didn&amp;#8217;t seem to do him any&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;If only this had happened a week later, Bertie! My next month&amp;#8217;s money was due
to roll in on Saturday. I could have worked a wheeze I&amp;#8217;ve been reading about
in the magazine advertisements. It seems that you can make a dashed amount of
money if you can only collect a few dollars and start a chicken-farm. Jolly
sound scheme, Bertie! Say you buy a hen—call it one hen for the sake of
argument. It lays an egg every day of the week. You sell the eggs seven for
twenty-five cents. Keep of hen costs nothing. Profit practically twenty-five
cents on every seven eggs. Or look at it another way: Suppose you have a dozen
eggs. Each of the hens has a dozen chickens. The chickens grow up and have
more chickens. Why, in no time you&amp;#8217;d have the place covered knee-deep in hens,
all laying eggs, at twenty-five cents for every seven. You&amp;#8217;d make a fortune.
Jolly life, too, keeping hens!&amp;#8221; He had begun to get quite worked up at the
thought of it, but he slopped back in his chair at this juncture with a good
deal of gloom. &amp;#8220;But, of course, it&amp;#8217;s no good,&amp;#8221; he said, &amp;#8220;because I haven&amp;#8217;t the&amp;nbsp;cash.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve only to say the word, you know, Bicky, old&amp;nbsp;top.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Thanks awfully, Bertie, but I&amp;#8217;m not going to sponge on&amp;nbsp;you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s always the way in this world. The chappies you&amp;#8217;d like to lend money to
won&amp;#8217;t let you, whereas the chappies you don&amp;#8217;t want to lend it to will do
everything except actually stand you on your head and lift the specie out of
your pockets. As a lad who has always rolled tolerably free in the right
stuff, I&amp;#8217;ve had lots of experience of the second class. Many&amp;#8217;s the time, back
in London, I&amp;#8217;ve hurried along Piccadilly and felt the hot breath of the
toucher on the back of my neck and heard his sharp, excited yapping as he
closed in on me. I&amp;#8217;ve simply spent my life scattering largesse to blighters I
didn&amp;#8217;t care a hang for; yet here was I now, dripping doubloons and pieces of
eight and longing to hand them over, and Bicky, poor fish, absolutely on his
uppers, not taking any at any&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Well, there&amp;#8217;s only one hope,&amp;nbsp;then.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;What&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;that?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Jeeves.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Sir?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was Jeeves, standing behind me, full of zeal. In this matter of
shimmering into rooms the chappie is rummy to a degree. You&amp;#8217;re sitting in the
old armchair, thinking of this and that, and then suddenly you look up, and
there he is. He moves from point to point with as little uproar as a jelly
fish. The thing startled poor old Bicky considerably. He rose from his seat
like a rocketing pheasant. I&amp;#8217;m used to Jeeves now, but often in the days when
he first came to me I&amp;#8217;ve bitten my tongue freely on finding him unexpectedly
in my&amp;nbsp;midst.&lt;/p&gt;
