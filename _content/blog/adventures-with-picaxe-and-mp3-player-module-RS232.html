I found that the MP3 module need about 6v and the PICAXE needs less than 5.5v.
This lead to a bit of head scratching and hurruffing until I got the great idea
to use a 4 AA pack and solder an extra lead to the 3rd battery for the PICAXE for
3x1.5v = 4.5v and share the common ground wiht the mp3 module for the TTL communication.

Simplified code to play the first song.
<code class="no-highlight">
  <pre>
symbol PLAY_BTN = C.1

main:
  touch PLAY_BTN, b1
  if b1 > 128 then
    goto play
  endif
  goto main

play:
  serout C.2, T4800, ($01)
  goto release

; wait untill released before accepting anymore commands
release:
  touch PLAY_BTN, b4
  if b4 > 128 then
    goto release
  else
    goto main
  endif
  </pre>
</code>
