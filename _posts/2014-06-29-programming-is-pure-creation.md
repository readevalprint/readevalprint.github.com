title: Programming is pure creation

Programming makes me feel as though I have some super power. A strange buggy, poorly optimized super power. 
The ability to create minions of dubious intellegence that will do my bidding with a few keystrokes and an imported library. The ability to break down any process and automate it so thoroughly I can replace people with a "shell script". Sadly, I've even programmed myself out of a job.
