title: Programming is pure creation

Programming makes me feel as though I have some a super power. A strangly autistic, buggy, poorly optimized super power. The ability to create minions of dubious intellegence that will do my bidding with a few keystrokes or an imported library. The ability to break down any process and automate it so thoroughly I can replace people with a "shell script". Sadly, I've even programmed myself out of a job on occasion. But where will this all go? Why type another method or class? Of what benifit is there in yet another templating implemtation? I don't feel special. But an outragous salery and pings from recruiters seem to indicate that this is a rare talent to speak to the worlds most subborn pendant, the computer.
