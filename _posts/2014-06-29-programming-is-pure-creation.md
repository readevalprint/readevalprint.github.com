title: Programming is pure creation

Programming makes me feel as though I have some a super power. A strangly autistic, buggy, poorly optimized super power. The ability to create minions of dubious intellegence to do my bidding with a few keystrokes or an imported library. The ability to break down any process and automate it so thoroughly I can replace people with a "shell script". Sadly, I've even programmed myself out of a job on occasion. 

But where will this all go? Why debug another method or class? Of what benifit is there in yet another templating implemtation? I don't feel special. But an outragous salary and pings from recruiters seem to indicate that this is a rare talent indeed. To be able speak to the worlds most subborn pendant, the computer. So I'll kindly take your cash, smile at your optimism, and type a few more lines, model your data, and if you ask nicely, I can even automate your pain away. There is no more pain. 

I feel a bit metaphysical so I'll go ahead an say it: Our lifes are for loops, decrimenting by from moment to moment. Waiting for the end conditional, or heaven forbid, some trial in life may thorw us an uncaught exception. And hopefully we have recursed into children before that. And then they too will loop. And then recurse. Until all our resources are reaped by the great [GC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) in the sky. But we will do our best.
