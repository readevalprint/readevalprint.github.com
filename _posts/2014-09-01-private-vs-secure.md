A great beer conversation kept me up thinking, what is the difference between security and privac on a philsophical, more than techincal, level.

"Entity" is information or an object.
"Privacy" is the ability to control access to an entity.Ex. Your browsing history data. Who you voted for in an election.
"Integrity" is the ability to determine the unity of an entity or to prevent its modification. Ex. Hash of a downloaded file. PGP signature of a message. RAID 1+. And the safety seal on a drink.
I was thinking that "security" is the degree that you can enforce the "privacy" and/or "integrity" of an entity. 
On the honor system, you won't read something if I tell you not to. My privacy is secured on your reputation.
A king can seal a note with wax and his ring. It's integrity is secured by how difficult it is to make the exact seal. The recipient can be sure that if the seal is unbroken, the contents have not been modified. But it's possible to hold it up to the light and read it. So it's privacy is not very secure. 
The physical integrity of the Mona Lisa is secured. But it is not private. 
Just my thoughts.
